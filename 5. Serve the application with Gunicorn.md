### Now we are going to serve the application with gunicorn through WSGI webserver. Firstly check gunicorn is installed or not by ```pip list```.
If it's already installed we can see it on the list of installed program. Otherwise

```sh
$ pip install gunicorn
```

And After installation just run the command.
```sh
$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 polling.wsgi
```
here ```polling``` is a example name of project
