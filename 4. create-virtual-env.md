# Creating a Python Virtual Environment for your Project

Now that we have our [database](https://github.com/lhmisho/DevOps-CICD/blob/main/setup-postgres.md), we can begin getting the rest of our project requirements ready. We will be installing our Python requirements within a virtual environment for easier management.

To do this, we first need access to the `virtualenv` command. We can install this with `pip`.

If you are using <b>Python 3</b>, upgrade `pip` and install the package by typing:

```sh
$ sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv
```

With `virtualenv` installed, we can start forming our project. Create and move into a directory where we can keep our project files:

```sh
$ mkdir ~/myprojectdir
$ cd ~/myprojectdir
```

Within the project directory, create a Python virtual environment by typing:

```sh
$ virtualenv myprojectenv
```

This will create a directory called `myprojectenv` within your `myprojectdir` directory. Inside, it will install a local version of Python and a local version of pip. We can use this to install and configure an isolated Python environment for our project.

Before we install our projectâ€™s Python requirements, we need to activate the virtual environment. You can do that by typing:

```sh
$ source myprojectenv/bin/activate
```

Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now operating within a Python virtual environment. It will look something like this: 
`(myprojectenv)user@host:~/myprojectdir$.`

With your virtual environment active, install Django, Gunicorn, and the `psycopg2` PostgreSQL adaptor with the local instance of `pip`:

```sh
$ pip install django gunicorn psycopg2
```

You should now have all of the software needed to start a Django project.
